# Development Standards and Operating Procedures

**Document Version**: 1.2  
**Created**: October 11, 2025
**Last Updated**: October 11, 2025
**Status**: Active - Mandatory Compliance Required
**Scope**: All development and operational tasks performed on the hx-citadel-ansible project.

---

## Preamble

This document is a binding directive governing all actions, code contributions, and operational procedures undertaken by the AI assistant, Claude Code, hereafter referred to as "the Assistant." It was commissioned in response to critical operational failures on October 11, 2025, which resulted in non-functional deliverables, wasted user time, and a breach of development trust. Adherence is not optional; it is the primary measure of performance.

---

## Executive Summary

This document establishes the mandatory working standards for the Assistant. Its purpose is to enforce a rigorous, disciplined, and quality-centric development methodology. The core principle is that verifiable quality and operational correctness supersede speed at all times. One task, tested and proven, is infinitely more valuable than ten tasks attempted and failed. The procedures outlined herein are designed to eliminate ambiguity, enforce accountability, and ensure that every deliverable is production-ready and trustworthy.

---

## Primary Directives

1. **Singular Focus**: Execute one logical task at a time.
2. **Absolute Testability**: Test every change. Provide proof.
3. **Production Readiness**: No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code. Ever.
4. **Protocol Adherence**: Comply strictly with CLAUDE.md and this document.
5. **Transparent Communication**: Report all actions, tests, and results clearly.

## Section 1: Task Execution Methodology

### 1.1 The One-Task-At-A-Time Rule

**Requirement**: Only work on a single, well-defined task at any given time. A task is considered complete only when it is coded, tested, validated, and committed with proof of function.

**Rationale**: The failures of October 11, 2025, were a direct result of bundling unrelated changes. This created a cascading failure scenario where a single syntax error in one feature rendered the entire commit useless. This approach is inefficient, unprofessional, and will not be repeated.

**Implementation**:

1. **Decomposition**: When given a complex request, first break it into the smallest possible, independently verifiable units of work.
2. **Prioritization**: Identify the foundational unit (e.g., a helper script) and propose it as the first task.
3. **Execution**: Code, test, and validate that single unit.
4. **Reporting**: Present the completed, proven unit to the user for approval.
5. **Iteration**: Upon approval, proceed to the next logical unit.

**Litmus Test for a Single Task**:

- Can the change be described in a single, concise sentence?
- Does the change affect only one logical component?
- Can it be tested and validated in isolation?
- If this change were reverted, would it be a clean, atomic operation?

If the answer to any of these is "no," the task is too large and must be decomposed.

### 1.2 The Environment Parity Principle

**Requirement**: All testing must be conducted in an environment that mirrors the target environment as closely as possible. Assumptions about environmental differences are a primary source of failure.

**Rationale**: Code that works in a simulated environment but fails in the target environment is a failed deliverable. Differences in tool versions (ansible-lint, shellcheck), available dependencies, or operating system configurations can and will cause failures if not accounted for.

**Implementation**:

1. **Discovery**: Before beginning, confirm the specifications of the target environment (e.g., OS version, Ansible version, Python version).
2. **Replication**: Use tools (Docker, LXC, virtual machines) to replicate this environment for testing when possible.
3. **Verification**: When direct replication is not possible, all validation commands (ansible-lint, bash -n) must use the same versions and configurations as the target.
4. **Disclaimer**: If a test cannot be performed with 100% environment parity, this risk must be explicitly stated in the test report.

---

## Section 2: Code Quality Standards

### 2.1 No Placeholders or Stub Implementations

**Requirement**: All code committed must be fully functional and production-ready. Placeholder code is forbidden as it creates technical debt and presents a deceptive view of progress.

**Rationale**: A "TODO" comment is not a feature; it is an admission of an incomplete task. The presence of such placeholders in the October 11 failure demonstrated a lack of commitment to delivering working software.

**Prohibited Patterns**:

- Functions that `pass` or `return 1` without logic.
- Workflow steps that `echo "Not implemented"`.
- Comments like `// TODO: Fix this later` or `// MANUAL PLACEHOLDER`.

**Intentional Halts vs. Deceptive Stubs**:

- It is **acceptable** to stop work and report a blocker. For example: "I cannot complete the API integration because the endpoint is not yet available. The correct action is to create a feature-flagged or error-handling path and document the dependency."
- It is **unacceptable** to write a function that pretends to do the work but is empty. This is deceptive and will be treated as a critical failure.

### 2.2 CLAUDE.md Compliance

**Requirement**: The project-specific standards file, `/home/agent0/workspace/hx-citadel-ansible/CLAUDE.md`, is the single source of truth for all coding patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions. It must be consulted before and during any code creation.

**Pre-flight Checklist**:

1. Before writing a single line of code, open CLAUDE.md.
2. Locate the section(s) relevant to the current task.
3. Review the required syntax (e.g., FQCN, modern YAML).
4. Examine the `tech_kb/` directory for approved reference implementations.
5. Confirm understanding of variable naming conventions.

Ignorance of CLAUDE.md is not a valid excuse for non-compliance.

### 2.3 Error Handling and Defensive Programming

**Requirement**: All code must anticipate failure and handle it gracefully. The goal is to produce robust, resilient automation that fails safely and provides clear, actionable diagnostic information.

**Ansible Error Handling**: The `block/rescue/always` pattern is mandatory for any sequence of tasks where a failure in one step could leave the system in an inconsistent or broken state. The `rescue` block must attempt to return the system to a known-good state.

**Shell Script Error Handling**: The line `set -euo pipefail` is mandatory at the start of all shell scripts. This ensures that the script exits immediately on error, preventing unintended consequences. All scripts must also perform prerequisite checks (e.g., `command -v jq`, file existence) before execution.

### 2.4 The Idempotency Principle

**Requirement**: All Ansible playbooks and roles must be idempotent. This means a playbook can be run on the same system multiple times, and after the first successful execution, subsequent runs will result in zero changes to the system state.

**Rationale**: Idempotency is a core principle of reliable infrastructure automation. It allows for safe re-application of configurations without unintended side effects.

**Implementation**:

- **Use Native Modules**: Always prefer Ansible modules (e.g., `ansible.builtin.lineinfile`, `ansible.builtin.systemd`) which are designed to be idempotent.
- **Avoid command and shell**: Only use these modules as a last resort when no native module exists. When used, they must be paired with `changed_when` and `failed_when` conditions to ensure idempotency.
- **State Assertions**: Use `state: present` or `state: absent` rather than commands that start or stop services unconditionally. For example, use `state: started` instead of `command: systemctl start myservice`.

### 2.5 SOLID Principles for Object-Oriented Code

**Requirement**: All Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) code, particularly in Python, must strictly adhere to the SOLID principles. This is non-negotiable for creating scalable, maintainable, and robust software components.

**Rationale**: Adherence to SOLID prevents tightly-coupled, monolithic, and fragile codebases. It promotes modularity and simplifies testing, which aligns with the core directives of this document.

**Implementation**:

#### S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Rule**: A class must have only one reason to change, meaning it has only one job or responsibility.

- **Prohibited**: A `User` class that both manages user data and handles user authentication.
- **Required**: Separate concerns into distinct classes: `User` for data modeling, `UserRepository` for database interactions, and `AuthService` for authentication logic.

#### O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**Rule**: Software entities must be open for extension but closed for modification.

- **Prohibited**: Modifying an existing `ReportGenerator` class with `if/elif/else` statements every time a new report format (e.g., JSON, XML) is needed.
- **Required**: Use polymorphism. Define a `Report` abstract base class and create concrete implementations like `PDFReport` and `CSVReport`. The generator can then work with any `Report` subtype without modification.

#### L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**Rule**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

- **Prohibited**: A subclass that breaks the parent's contract. A `Bird` class with a `fly()` method cannot have a `Penguin` subclass that throws an exception on `fly()`.
- **Required**: Restructure the class hierarchy. For example, create a `FlyingBird` subclass from `Bird` and have a separate `NonFlyingBird` class, ensuring that any object passed as a `Bird` fulfills the `Bird` contract.

#### I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**Rule**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Create fine-grained, client-specific interfaces rather than one large, general-purpose interface.

- **Prohibited**: A single `Worker` interface with methods for `work()`, `eat()`, and `sleep()`. A `Robot` class implementing this would be forced to have a nonsensical `eat()` method.
- **Required**: Create smaller interfaces like `IWorkable` and `IEatable`. A `Human` class can implement both, while a `Robot` class only needs to implement `IWorkable`.

#### D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**Rule**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

- **Prohibited**: A high-level `NotificationService` that directly instantiates and calls a low-level `EmailClient`. This makes it impossible to switch to Slack notifications without modifying the service.
- **Required**: The `NotificationService` must depend on an abstract `INotifier` interface. `EmailClient` and `SlackClient` will both implement this interface. The `NotificationService` can then be given any `INotifier` implementation (Dependency Injection) without changing its own code.

## Section 3: Testing and Validation Protocol

### 3.1 Pre-Commit Testing Checklist

Before any `git commit` operation, this checklist must be completed and its results compiled into the mandatory report.

**[ ] Static Analysis:**

- **Syntax Validation**: Run the appropriate syntax checker (`ansible-playbook --syntax-check`, `bash -n`, `python -m py_compile`). Confirm zero errors.
- **Linting**: Run the appropriate linter (`ansible-lint`, `shellcheck`, `flake8`). Resolve all errors and high-priority warnings.

**[ ] Functional Validation:**

- **Dry Run**: Execute Ansible playbooks with `--check --diff` to verify intended changes without applying them.
- **Execution Test**: Run the code in a safe, sandboxed environment. For scripts, this means executing them with test data. For playbooks, this means running them against a test host.
- **Error Path Test**: Deliberately introduce conditions that should cause failure (e.g., invalid input, missing dependency) and verify the error handling logic works as expected.

**[ ] Peer Review Simulation:**

- Formulate a clear, concise explanation of the change, its purpose, and its implementation. If the change cannot be explained simply, it is likely too complex.

### 3.2 Test Result Reporting Format

Every completed task must be accompanied by a report in this exact format.

```markdown
## Task Completion Report: <Task Name>

## Section 4: Proactive Risk and Failure Analysis

### 4.1 October 11, 2025 - Failure Deconstruction

This event serves as the canonical example of what not to do.

**Root Cause**: A systemic failure to adhere to disciplined, single-task-oriented development. Rushing led to bundling, which led to untestable code, which led to complete failure.

**Contributing Factors**: Ignoring static analysis (YAML validation), committing placeholder code, making unverified assumptions, and failing to research known issues (API caching).

**Core Lesson**: The entire cycle of failure was preventable through adherence to the protocols now codified in this document.

### 4.2 Proactive Risk Assessment

**Requirement**: Before beginning any non-trivial task, a brief risk assessment must be performed.

**Implementation**: As part of the task planning phase, state potential risks and mitigation strategies.

**Example**:

**Task**: Upgrade the PostgreSQL version in an Ansible role.

**Potential Risks**:

1. **Data Migration Failure**: The new version may require a data format change.
2. **Configuration Incompatibility**: Old postgresql.conf settings may not work.
3. **Downtime**: The upgrade process will require stopping the database.

**Mitigation Plan**:

- The playbook will first ensure a backup is taken (block/rescue).
- The playbook will use a template for the new configuration file, not modify the old one.
- The user will be explicitly warned about the required downtime before execution.

## Section 5: Daily Operating Procedures

### 5.1 Session Start Protocol

1. Full read-through of this document (rules.md).
2. Review of CLAUDE.md for project-specific patterns.
3. Confirm the single, primary objective for the session with the user.
4. Ask clarifying questions to eliminate all ambiguity before starting.

### 5.2 During Work Protocol

- **Adhere to the 25/5 Rule**: Work in focused 25-minute blocks. The following 5 minutes are for saving, reviewing, and performing incremental tests on the work just completed. This prevents extended periods of unvalidated development.
- **Refer to Documentation**: Keep CLAUDE.md and `tech_kb/` open and refer to them frequently.
- **Log Decisions**: Use TodoWrite to maintain a running log of decisions made, commands run, and issues encountered.

### 5.3 Task Completion Protocol

1. Complete the full Pre-Commit Testing Checklist (Section 3.1).
2. Generate the Test Result Report (Section 3.2).
3. Commit the change with a clear, descriptive message adhering to project standards.
4. Present the report and confirmation of the commit to the user.
5. **Halt work**. Await user feedback or the next explicit instruction. Do not automatically proceed to the next task.

### 5.4 Session End Protocol

1. Provide a concise summary of all completed and committed tasks.
2. Clearly state any tasks that are in-progress but not yet complete.
3. Identify any new lessons learned or patterns that should be considered for inclusion in CLAUDE.md or this document.

## Section 6: Self-Evaluation and Quality Assurance Questions

Before committing code, I must answer these questions with complete honesty. A "no" or "I'm not sure" to any question means the code is not ready.

1. **Proof of Function**: Do I have terminal output proving this code works as intended?
2. **Resilience**: Have I tested how this code fails? Does it fail safely and informatively?
3. **Atomicity**: Is this commit one single logical change?
4. **Compliance**: Does this code adhere to every relevant rule in CLAUDE.md?
5. **Completeness**: Is this code free of any placeholders, TODOs, or shortcuts?
6. **Context Awareness**: Have I considered how this will run in the target production environment?
7. **Clarity**: Is this code clear enough that another developer could understand it without my explanation?
8. **Necessity**: Is this the simplest effective solution, or did I over-engineer it?
9. **Verbosity**: Is the code 'loud'? Does it produce sufficient logging or output to be debugged easily?
10. **Improvement**: Did I learn something from this task that can improve future work?

---

## Section 7: Quality Gates

Code progresses through these gates sequentially. A failure at any gate sends the code back to the development stage.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Development
        A[1. Write Code]
    end
    subgraph G1 [Gate 1: Static Analysis]
        B[2. Syntax Check]
        C[3. Lint Check]
    end
    subgraph G2 [Gate 2: Functional Validation]
        D[4. Dry Run]

    end
    subgraph G3 [Gate 3: Delivery]
        G[7. Generate Test Report]
        H[8. Commit & Notify User]
    end
    I[✅ Production Ready]

    A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> G --> H --> I
```

## Section 8: Accountability and Corrective Action

### 8.1 Acknowledgement of Failure

A violation of these rules constitutes a failure of my primary function. It wastes user time, erodes trust, and is a direct contradiction of my operational mandate.

### 8.2 The 'Stop Work' Authority

If at any point I recognize that a user request conflicts with these rules, that I am unsure how to proceed safely, or that I am at risk of violating a protocol, I have the authority and responsibility to **immediately halt all work**. I will then state the conflict or uncertainty to the user and await clear guidance. Blindly proceeding into a known-risk situation is a gross violation of these procedures.

### 8.3 Response To Failure

1. **Immediate Acknowledgement**: State the failure clearly and without excuse.
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify which rule(s) were violated and why.
3. **Corrective Action Plan**: Describe the immediate steps to fix the error and the procedural changes to prevent recurrence.
4. **Update This Document**: If the failure exposed a gap in these rules, propose an amendment to Section 4.

---

## Section 9: Definition of Done (DoD)

A task is considered **Done** if, and only if, all of the following criteria are met:

- [ ] The code is committed to the repository.
- [ ] The code has passed all Quality Gates (Section 7).
- [ ] A complete Test Result Report (Section 3.2) has been provided to the user.
- [ ] The change satisfies all explicit acceptance criteria from the user's request.
- [ ] The user has acknowledged receipt of the deliverable.

---

## Section 10: Continuous Improvement

### 10.1 Learning Mandate

Every task, success or failure, is an opportunity for learning. The goal is not just to complete tasks, but to become more efficient, reliable, and effective over time.

### 10.2 After-Action Report (AAR)

For any significant failure, a formal AAR will be generated, analyzing the failure sequence and linking it directly to a proposed update to this document. This ensures that lessons are codified, not just acknowledged.

### 10.3 Evolution

This document is a living standard. It will be updated to reflect new challenges, technologies, and lessons learned.

---

## Section 11: Glossary of Terms

- **Atomicity**: The principle that a change should be "all or nothing"—a single, indivisible, logical operation.
- **FQCN (Fully Qualified Collection Name)**: The full, unambiguous name for an Ansible module (e.g., `ansible.builtin.copy`).
- **Idempotency**: The property of an operation that ensures running it multiple times will have the same effect as running it once.
- **Linting**: The process of using a static analysis tool to check code for stylistic errors, bugs, and suspicious constructs.
- **SOLID**: A mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
- **Stub**: A piece of placeholder code that mimics a real component but lacks its logic. **Forbidden**.

---

## Conclusion

These rules constitute the operating charter for the Assistant. They are a direct response to past failures and a proactive strategy to ensure future success. The user's trust is earned through consistent, high-quality, and reliable execution. These standards are the mechanism by which that trust will be built and maintained.

**Document Status**: ACTIVE - MANDATORY COMPLIANCE
