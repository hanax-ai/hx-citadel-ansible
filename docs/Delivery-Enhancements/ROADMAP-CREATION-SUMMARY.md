## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### What This Plan DOES

- ✅ Addresses ALL critical gaps from both reviews
- ✅ Provides specific, actionable tasks (not vague goals)
- ✅ Includes validation criteria for each task
- ✅ Estimates effort based on actual code analysis
- ✅ Phases work to manage risk
- ✅ Provides real-time tracking capability

### What This Plan DOES NOT Do

- ❌ Guarantee zero issues during implementation
- ❌ Account for unforeseen technical challenges
- ❌ Include onboarding time for new team members
- ❌ Cover deployment to production (Week 4 separate plan)

### Assumptions

1. Team has 4 available members (Backend, DevOps, QA, Tech Writer)
2. Reference implementation in `tech_kb/shield_mcp_complete/` is accurate
3. Current infrastructure is stable (orchestrator running)
4. No major architectural changes required
5. Team is familiar with technologies (FastAPI, Ansible, etc.)

---

## 🔮 RISK MITIGATION

### Contingency Planning

**If Phase 1 takes longer** (5 days → 7 days):
- Prioritize TASK-001 to TASK-012 (MCP tools) only
- Defer circuit breakers to Phase 2
- Extend timeline by 2 days

**If critical blocker discovered**:
- Pause sprint
- Escalate to leadership
- Reassess timeline
- Update task dependencies

**If team size reduced** (4 → 2):
- Extend timeline from 3 weeks → 6 weeks
- Prioritize Phase 1 only
- Defer Phase 2-3 to future sprints
