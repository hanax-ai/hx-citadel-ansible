## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**As a** Line-of-Business power user  
**I want** an advanced web interface to interact with the Shield RAG system  
**So that** I can efficiently manage knowledge ingestion, monitor processing status in real-time, visualize the knowledge graph, and curate data quality

### Detailed User Journey

**Step 1: User Accesses Interface**
- User navigates to Shield AG-UI web application
- User logs in with corporate credentials
- User sees dashboard with current system status

**Step 2: User Initiates Document Ingestion**
- User selects "Crawl Website" or "Upload Document"
- User provides source URL or file upload
- User configures parameters (page limits, filters, etc.)
- User submits job

**Step 3: User Monitors Real-Time Progress**
- System immediately returns job ID
- User sees real-time progress bar updating
- User views event timeline showing each processing step
- User sees chunks being processed (e.g., "Processing chunk 15 of 85")
- User receives notifications for milestones (crawl complete, embeddings generated, etc.)

**Step 4: User Visualizes Knowledge Graph**
- User views interactive knowledge graph visualization
- User sees entities (people, places, concepts) as nodes
- User sees relationships as edges between nodes
- User can zoom, pan, and click to explore connections
- User sees new entities appear in real-time as processing continues

**Step 5: User Queries Knowledge**
- User types natural language question
- User selects query mode (naive, local, global, hybrid)
- User receives answer with source citations
- User sees which parts of knowledge graph were used
- User views confidence scores for retrieved information

**Step 6: User Curates Knowledge Quality**
- User identifies incorrect or duplicate entities in graph
- User merges duplicate entities
- User edits entity attributes
- User deletes low-confidence relationships
- User approves high-confidence additions

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** user is logged in, **When** user submits web crawl for "https://python.org", **Then** system returns job ID within 2 seconds and begins showing progress updates

2. **Given** web crawl is in progress, **When** system processes each page, **Then** user sees event timeline update with "Page crawled: [URL]" within 100ms of event occurrence

3. **Given** knowledge graph is being built, **When** system extracts entities, **Then** user sees nodes appear in real-time graph visualization

4. **Given** user has job ID, **When** user navigates to job tracking dashboard, **Then** user sees current status, progress percentage, time elapsed, and estimated completion time

5. **Given** user wants to query knowledge, **When** user types question and selects "hybrid" mode, **Then** system returns answer combining graph traversal and vector search results with source citations

6. **Given** user sees duplicate entities in graph, **When** user selects both and clicks "Merge", **Then** system consolidates entities and preserves all relationships

7. **Given** crawl job fails, **When** error occurs, **Then** user sees clear error message, suggested remediation, and option to retry

8. **Given** multiple users are active, **When** one user triggers ingestion, **Then** only that user sees progress events for their job (event isolation)

9. **Given** user disconnects during long-running job, **When** user reconnects, **Then** user can resume viewing progress from current state (no lost events)

10. **Given** system is under load, **When** user submits request, **Then** user receives either immediate response or queue position with estimated wait time

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when** user tries to crawl a site with 10,000+ pages?
  ‚Üí System enforces configurable page limits (default: 1000 max), warns user, allows override with confirmation

- **What happens when** knowledge graph grows to 50,000+ entities?
  ‚Üí Visualization switches to cluster view, allows filtering by entity type, date range, confidence score

- **What happens when** user's query matches no knowledge?
  ‚Üí System clearly indicates "No relevant information found in knowledge base" and suggests expanding ingestion sources

- **What happens when** two users try to edit the same entity simultaneously?
  ‚Üí System uses optimistic locking, second edit receives "Entity modified by another user" notification with option to review changes and retry

- **What happens when** background job fails after 50% completion?
  ‚Üí System preserves processed data, marks job as "partially complete", allows user to resume or retry from beginning

- **What happens when** user has 10+ jobs running concurrently?
  ‚Üí System enforces per-user job limits (default: 10 concurrent), queues additional jobs, shows queue position

- **What happens when** Redis connection drops during event streaming?
  ‚Üí User sees "Connection lost" notification, system auto-reconnects within 5 seconds, resumes event stream from last acknowledged position

    - Marks job as "Cancelled by user"
    - Shows final status (e.g., "50% complete when cancelled")

**Edge Cases**:
- **Given** user has 100+ completed jobs, **Then** system paginates results (20 per page) with search/filter
- **Given** job is in critical phase (e.g., saving to database), **Then** cancel request waits for safe stopping point before terminating

### Scenario 7: Error Handling and Recovery

**Failure Scenarios**:

1. **Given** network connection to backend is lost
   **When** user is viewing dashboard
   **Then** user sees "Connection lost - attempting to reconnect" banner, system retries every 5 seconds, connection restores without data loss

2. **Given** background service (Orchestrator) is down
   **When** user tries to execute query
   **Then** user receives clear message "RAG service temporarily unavailable - please try again in a few moments" with estimated recovery time

3. **Given** Redis event stream is unavailable
   **When** user is monitoring job progress
   **Then** system switches to polling mode (check status every 5 seconds) with notification "Real-time updates unavailable - showing polling updates"

4. **Given** knowledge graph becomes corrupted
   **When** user tries to visualize graph
   **Then** system shows partial graph with clear indication "Some data may be missing - system recovering" and notifies administrators

5. **Given** user's browser runs out of memory (large graph)
   **When** rendering 50,000+ node graph
   **Then** system detects performance issue, switches to simplified view, prompts user to apply filters

### Scenario 8: Multi-User Concurrency

**Primary Flow**:
1. **Given** User A and User B are both logged in
2. **When** User A submits web crawl
3. **Then** only User A sees progress events for that job (event isolation)

4. **Given** User A is editing Entity X
5. **When** User B tries to edit Entity X
6. **Then** User B sees "Entity is being edited by User A" with option to view read-only or wait

7. **Given** both users are viewing knowledge graph
8. **When** User A's job adds new entity
9. **Then** both users see new entity appear in their graph views (shared graph state)

**Edge Cases**:
- **Given** 20 users submit jobs simultaneously, **Then** system queues jobs fairly (FIFO) and shows queue position to each user
- **Given** system is at user capacity (10 concurrent), **Then** 11th user receives "System at capacity - please wait" message
