## USAGE GUIDELINES

### When to Create a Status Report
1. **Weekly Updates** - Every Monday or end of sprint
2. **Major Deployments** - After deploying to production
3. **Incident Resolution** - After resolving critical issues
4. **Milestone Completion** - When major features are delivered
5. **Monthly Reviews** - End of month summary

### What to Include
✅ **DO Include:**
- Factual information and metrics
- Specific dates and hostnames
- Links to related documentation
- Action items with owners
- Lessons learned from changes

❌ **DON'T Include:**
- Sensitive passwords or keys (use vault references)
- Personal opinions without context
- Vague statements without data
- Unverified assumptions

### Maintenance
- Archive status reports older than 6 months to `status/archive/`
- Keep the most recent 10-15 reports in main `status/` directory
- Reference older reports by linking, not duplicating content
- Update this template as the project evolves

### Cross-Referencing
- Link to configuration documents in `configuration/` directory
- Reference deployment templates in `templates/` directory
- Point to specific playbooks in `playbooks/` directory
- Include commit hashes for traceability
