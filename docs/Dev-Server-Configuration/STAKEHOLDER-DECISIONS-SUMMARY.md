- ✅ Encrypted backups
- ✅ 90-day audit log retention

### Audit Log Scope (Complete Event Capture)

**Authentication Events**:
- Login success/failure
- Password reset/change
- MFA enroll/verify/disable
- Account lockout/unlock

**Access & Role Events**:
- Role grants/revokes
- Scope changes (workspace/project)
- Permission model updates
- SSO setting changes (future)
- API key create/rotate/revoke

**Data Events**:
- Create/Read/Update/Delete on sensitive objects
- Exports/downloads
- Retention/purge actions
- File upload/delete

**System & Operations Events**:

### Burst Handling Pattern (10 → 50 concurrent)

**Strategy**:

**Level 1 (10-20 users)**: Normal operation
- All features enabled
- Real-time graph animations
- Full compute allocation

**Level 2 (20-35 users)**: Light degradation
- Queue non-critical background jobs
- Reduce graph auto-layout frequency (30s → 60s)
- Batch similar requests

**Level 3 (35-50 users)**: Moderate degradation
- Show backpressure banner: "System busy - requests queued"
- Display queue position and estimated wait time
- Disable non-essential animations
- Circuit breakers active on heavy endpoints

**Level 4 (50+ users)**: Heavy degradation
- New requests queued with 503 "Service Temporarily Unavailable"
- Banner: "System at capacity - please wait"
- Critical functions only (queries, job status)
- Automatic scale-up triggered (if available)

**Recovery**:
- As load decreases, automatically restore features
- Clear degradation banner
- Resume normal operation
