# Devin: Shield AG-UI Code Development Assignment

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Project**: HX-Citadel Shield AG-UI  
**Your Role**: Code Development & GitHub Commits  
**Deployment**: Will be handled by HX team after your code is complete  
**Priority**: HIGH - Ready to begin

---

## üéØ Your Scope: Code Development Only

### What You Will Do:
‚úÖ Review all documentation  
‚úÖ Create Ansible role structure  
‚úÖ Write backend FastAPI code  
‚úÖ Integrate frontend Vite + React code  
‚úÖ Create Docker Compose configurations  
‚úÖ Create Nginx configuration  
‚úÖ Write all necessary templates and handlers  
‚úÖ Commit all code to GitHub  
‚úÖ Ensure code quality and completeness  

### What You Will NOT Do:
‚ùå Deploy to hx-dev-server (no network access)  
‚ùå Run Ansible playbooks (HX team will do this)  
‚ùå Test against live HX-Citadel services  
‚ùå Access internal network (192.168.10.x)  

### Handoff Point:
When you complete all code and commit to GitHub, the HX team will:
1. Review your code
2. Run the Ansible playbook on hx-test-server
3. Deploy to hx-dev-server (192.168.10.12)
4. Test against live services

---

## üìã Your Task

Develop the complete Shield AG-UI application code using the **hybrid approach** (Vite + React + FastAPI + AG-UI Python SDK + Docker).

**Before starting implementation**, you must:
1. Review ALL documentation in the specified order
2. Understand the complete architecture and requirements
3. Confirm task scope and dependencies
4. Ask any clarifying questions
5. Get approval before beginning coding

---

## üìÅ Documentation to Review

**Location**: `/home/agent0/hx-citadel-ansible/docs/Dev-Server-Configuration/`

### Review Order (FOLLOW THIS SEQUENCE):

#### Step 1: Start with README.md (5 minutes)
**File**: `README.md` (529 lines)

**What to understand**:
- Overall project vision
- Technology stack (Vite + React + FastAPI + Docker)
- Timeline (8 days)
- Budget ($12,000 approved)
- Document structure and navigation
- **Your role**: Code development, NOT deployment

**Key Question**: Do you understand the hybrid approach and that you're creating code for others to deploy?

---

#### Step 2: Review Stakeholder Decisions (10 minutes)
**File**: `STAKEHOLDER-DECISIONS-SUMMARY.md` (910 lines)

**What to understand**:
- All 10 stakeholder questions and answers
- Critical decisions (Auth, RBAC, retention)
- Permissions matrix (Admin/Contributor/Viewer)
- Performance targets (P95 ‚â§ 800ms @ 10 users)
- Browser support (Chrome + Edge, latest 2 versions)
- Accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.2 AA)

**Key Question**: Do you understand all the non-negotiable requirements your code must meet?

---

#### Step 3: Study Architecture (30 minutes)
**File**: `SHIELD-AG-UI-ARCHITECTURE.md` (2,201 lines, 21+ diagrams)

**What to understand**:
- 3-tier architecture (Vite SPA, FastAPI, Nginx)
- Docker Compose stack (3 containers)
- Redis Streams event bus architecture
- SSE (Server-Sent Events) for real-time updates
- Integration points with 7 HX-Citadel services:
  - hx-litellm-server:4000
  - hx-orchestrator-server:8000
  - hx-sqldb-server:6379 (Redis)
  - hx-vectordb-server:6333 (Qdrant)
  - hx-sqldb-server:5432 (PostgreSQL)
  - hx-ollama1/2
- Security architecture (4 layers)
- Authentication & RBAC flows

**Important**: These services exist but you won't access them. Write code that will connect to them when deployed.

**Key Questions**: 
- Do you understand how events flow from Redis ‚Üí Backend ‚Üí Frontend via SSE?
- Can you write code that connects to these services via environment variables?
- Do you understand the Docker networking setup?

---

#### Step 4: Review Specification (15 minutes)
**File**: `SHIELD-AG-UI-SPECIFICATION.md` (858 lines)

**What to understand**:
- 8 user scenarios with acceptance criteria
- 90 requirements (60 FR + 30 NFR)
- Success metrics and KPIs
- What's in scope vs out of scope

**Key Question**: Can you list the 9 pages that must be implemented and their main features?

---

#### Step 5: Study Implementation Plan (45 minutes)
**File**: `DEV-SERVER-AG-UI-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` (2,086 lines)

**What to understand**:
- Complete Ansible role design (you create the role structure/files)
- Docker configuration details (you create docker-compose.yml)
- Code examples (Python + TypeScript)
- Frontend: How to integrate existing Vite app (6,500 LOC)
- Backend: How to build FastAPI with AG-UI Python SDK
- Testing strategy (unit tests you can write)
- SOLID principles application

**Key Questions**:
- Do you understand you're creating Ansible role FILES, not running them?
- Do you know where to clone the frontend from? (github.com/hanax-ai/citadel-shield-ui, feature-1 branch)
- Do you understand what needs to be removed (Supabase) and added (backend API client)?

---

#### Step 6: Review Task Breakdown (30 minutes)

## üß™ Testing Strategy (Your Scope)

### What You Should Test:

#### 1. Syntax & Linting
```bash
# Python
python -m py_compile roles/shield_ag_ui/files/backend/**/*.py
ruff check roles/shield_ag_ui/files/backend/

# TypeScript/JavaScript
cd roles/shield_ag_ui/files/frontend/
npm run lint

# YAML
yamllint roles/shield_ag_ui/

# Ansible
ansible-lint roles/shield_ag_ui/
```

#### 2. Unit Tests (Mock Services)
```python
# Example: Test backend with mocked Redis
@pytest.fixture
def mock_redis():
    return MagicMock()

def test_redis_consumer(mock_redis):
    consumer = RedisConsumer(mock_redis)
    # Test logic without real Redis
```

#### 3. Docker Build Tests
```bash
# Test Docker builds (don't run)
cd roles/shield_ag_ui/templates/
docker build -f backend.Dockerfile.j2 --no-cache .
docker build -f frontend.Dockerfile.j2 --no-cache .
```

### What HX Team Will Test:

- Ansible playbook execution
- Deployment to hx-dev-server
- Connection to live services
- End-to-end user scenarios
- Performance under load
- Security scanning
