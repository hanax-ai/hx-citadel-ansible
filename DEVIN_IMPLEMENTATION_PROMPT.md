**Before starting implementation**, you must:
1. Review ALL documentation in the specified order
2. Understand the complete architecture and requirements
3. Confirm task scope and dependencies
4. Ask any clarifying questions
5. Get approval before beginning implementation

**File**: `DEV-SERVER-AG-UI-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` (2,086 lines)

**What to understand**:
- Complete Ansible role design
- Docker configuration details
- Code examples (Python + TypeScript)
- Frontend: How to integrate existing Vite app (6,500 LOC)
- Backend: How to build FastAPI with AG-UI Python SDK
- Testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E)
- SOLID principles application

**Key Questions**:
- Do you understand the frontend is EXISTING code that needs integration, not new development?
- Do you know where to clone the frontend from? (github.com/hanax-ai/citadel-shield-ui, feature-1 branch)
- Do you understand what needs to be removed (Supabase) and added (backend API client)?

---

#### Step 6: Review Task Breakdown (30 minutes)
**Directory**: `tasks/`

**Review in this order**:

**a) tasks/README.md** (335 lines)
- Master task index
- 16 total tasks (5 documented, 11 planned)
- Dependencies graph
- Parallel execution strategy
- Execution timeline

**b) tasks/T001-create-ansible-role.md** (273 lines)
- First task (1 hour effort)
- Create Ansible role structure
- 8 task files, templates, handlers

**c) tasks/T002-backend-fastapi-app.md** (606 lines)
- Backend implementation (4 hours)
- FastAPI + AG-UI Python SDK
- Redis Streams consumer
- SSE endpoint
- Complete code examples

**d) tasks/T003-frontend-vite-integration.md** (708 lines)
- Frontend integration (2 hours - REDUCED from 6h)
- Clone existing citadel-shield-ui repository
- Remove Supabase dependencies
- Connect to FastAPI backend
- Fix CodeRabbit findings (15 issues)

**e) tasks/T004-docker-compose-config.md** (401 lines)

- 3 services configuration
- Networks, volumes, health checks

**f) tasks/T005-nginx-reverse-proxy.md** (489 lines)
- Nginx configuration (1 hour)
- Reverse proxy setup
- SSL/TLS termination
