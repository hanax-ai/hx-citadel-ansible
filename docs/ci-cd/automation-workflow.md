A Linear workflow integrated with GitHub automates the synchronization of issue and pull request (PR) statuses, streamlining the development process. This integration aims to minimize manual updates and keep both platforms consistent.
Setup:
Connect Linear to GitHub: A Linear admin connects the workspace to a GitHub organization or repository. This grants Linear the necessary permissions to access and update information in GitHub.
Map Repositories to Teams (Optional): For multi-repository projects or larger organizations, specific GitHub repositories can be mapped to corresponding teams within Linear, ensuring issues and PRs are routed correctly.
Configure Branch Naming Convention: Linear suggests a branch naming convention (e.g., identifier-title) that includes the Linear issue ID. This is crucial for automatically linking branches and PRs to their respective Linear issues.
Set Up Workflow Automations: Within Linear's team settings, automations can be configured to automatically change the status of Linear issues based on GitHub PR or commit events (e.g., moving an issue to "In Progress" when a PR is opened, or "Done" when a PR is merged).
Enable Personal GitHub Automations: Individual users can enable personal settings in Linear to automatically assign issues to themselves and move them to "In Progress" when they create a related branch or PR.
Workflow in Action:
Issue Creation: Issues are created in Linear, outlining the work to be done.
Branch Creation: Developers create new branches in GitHub using the configured naming convention, including the Linear issue ID.
Automatic Status Updates: As development progresses and PRs are opened, reviewed, and merged in GitHub, Linear automatically updates the corresponding issue's status, assignee, and other relevant fields.
Two-Way Sync: Comments, status changes, and other updates made in Linear can also be reflected in the linked GitHub PR or issue, and vice versa.
Enhanced Visibility: The integration provides a centralized view of the development progress within Linear, with direct links to the relevant GitHub PRs and commits.
Benefits:
Reduced Manual Effort: Minimizes the need for developers to manually update issue statuses in Linear.
Improved Synchronization: Ensures that issue and development statuses are consistent across both platforms.
Increased Visibility: Provides a clear overview of the development pipeline for all stakeholders.
Streamlined Collaboration: Facilitates communication and collaboration between development teams and project managers.
