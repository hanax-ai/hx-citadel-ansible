Integration tests for MCP server health checks

Phase 2 Sprint 2.2: Automated Testing (TASK-033)

Environment Variables for Test Enablement:
- MCP_SERVER_URL: URL of MCP server (e.g., http://localhost:8000)
- ORCHESTRATOR_URL: URL of orchestrator API (e.g., http://localhost:8080)

If not set, tests will be skipped automatically.
